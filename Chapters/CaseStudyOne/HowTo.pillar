!! Style

Each presenter can add a style to the application style. 



so, you want the text box to have a size, not the text inside?
then you need to add a style
textPresenter addStyle: 'aStyleName'
the only real problem here is that styles need to be defined at "startup" time of your application
you can check StPharoApplication as inspiration
it had this method: 
resetConfiguration
    
    self flag: #TODO. "Replace this with a proper initialization mechanism (which is not
    implemented at the moment, and we need to choose the backend from it)"
    self class environment 
        at: #StPharoMorphicConfiguration
        ifPresent: [ :aClass | self useBackend: #Morphic with: aClass new ]
which is a bit overcomplicated
but is to avoid false dependencies reports
then the class: StPharoMorphicConfiguration has this methods: 
StPharoMorphicConfiguration >> configureOSX: anApplication
    
    anApplication styleSheet: (self styleSheet, self styleSheetOSX)
    
StPharoMorphicConfiguration >> styleSheetOSX
    "Just an example on how to build styles programatically ;)"

    ^ SpStyle newApplication 
        addClass: 'label' with: [ :label |
            label addClass: 'shortcut' with: [ :shortcut |
                shortcut addPropertyFontWith: [ :font |
                    font name: 'Lucida Grande'; size: 10 ] ] ];
        yourself
So you could have 
MyAppMorphicConfiguration >> myStyleSheet 

  ^ SpStyleSTONReader fromString: '
.application [
  .aStyleName [
    Geometry { 
      #height: 100, 
      #width: 100, 
      #vResizing: false, 
      #hResizing: false }
  ]
]
' 
which I know seems overwhelming for your small problem, but take into account this is the attempt of a general solution to style applications :wink:
cool part is, once you define your stylesheet, changing appearances and/or sizes is just adding the desired style(s) to your widget.
for example, for a personal project I have this extension method on SpPresenter :
newSmallButton

    ^ self newButton 
        "addStyle: 'flat';"
        addStyle: 'smallButton';
        addStyle: 'smallFont';
        addStyle: 'dim';
        yourself


!! Icon 

n Spec we recently introduced the icon provider hierarchy
where you can define your own (by inheritance)
but we provide a couple of interesting pre-defined providers
SpPharoThemeIconProvider will delegate to the current system icons (Same as doing Smalltalk ui icons)
SpLocationIconProvider will alloyou to add a location (you can actually have a list of locations) from where to get your icons (externally to the image)
and SpCompositeIconProvider will allow you to compose providers, so you can do things like  : myLocationProvider, defaultProvider
SpApplication defines the methods
iconNamed:, iconProvider and newIconProvider  which you can play to provide your own
e.g. StPharoApplication defines 
newIconProvider

[[[
    ^ StPharoDefaultIconProvider new
and as an example, for the same application I have the newSmallButton extension, I have 
newIconProvider

    ^ (SpLocationIconProvider newLocation: self iconsDir), 
        SgaGtkThemeIconProvider new
so... the trick is again based on the correct definition of your application
btw, my "iconsDir" method is defined like this (is temporal) : 
 iconsDir

    self flag: #TODO. "Refactor this into a production/development environments"
    IceRepository registry 
        detect: [ :each | each name = 'Crono' ]
        ifFound: [ :each | ^ each location / 'resources' / 'icons'  ].
    
    ^ FileLocator imageDirectory / 'resources' / 'icons'
